### JS30 - Exercise 6 - Type Ahead
I am following Exercise 6 of [JS30](http://www.javascript30.com) to practice:

* Writing ES6 javascript
* Fetching data from an API endpoint
* Using promises
* Pushing data that is returned into an array by spreading into the array using (...data) syntax
* Getting text from a searchbox by using querySelector, and passing the data to a display function via the callback
* Writing regex to match text.
* Formatting matched text by replacing it with interpolated HTML to highlight it

To do:

I would like to pull out the lat/long data and display it in a map with the Google Javascript API
